# the-NWR-Project
> An open source game engine/editor that will eventually use its own programming language based on C++.

## Introduction
> the NWR Project is only being created on by me, Tristan Sunico.
> the NWR Project still has a long way to go, so the .exe isn't going to be public for a while.

## Installing the NWR Project
> Step 1: Once the .exe is public, download it from the \build folder!

## Dependencies
* C++ Standard library
* g++ (External compiler)
* Visual Studio Code (Software editor)
